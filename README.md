This is the Drupal 9 website for Xylot Themes version 7.

# Xylot Themes
**Xylot Themes** is an information warehouse for everything related to professional wrestling music, from entrance themes to menu tracks from hard-to-find DVD releases.

## Version 7.x
There have been **six** iterations of Xylot Themes ever since its rudimentary inception in 2005. This site is its 7th, hence the version number of 7. The initial alpha version of this website will be _7.0.0_.

## Future Expansion
Xylot Themes will eventually expand to become an overall data warehouse (simply named Xylot) for all things pro wrestling. Offerings will include: pay-per-view and episodic series results; championship histories; and win/loss stats for wrestlers and talent. Xylot will be a demonstration of the various and interesting ways that pro wrestling data can be agreggated and used, as well as a one-stop destination for all things pro wrestling.

Far-future plans include reviving the _YourKliq_ idea &mdash; a social network dedicated to connecting fans with wrestlers, promotions, and each other &mdash; in a way that will integrate well with the overall Xylot portal idea.
